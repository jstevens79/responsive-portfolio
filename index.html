        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img class="profilePic" src="assets/images/IMG_0099.jpg" alt="Joshua Stevens bio photo">
        <p>I was born in middle-of-nowhere Indiana, surrounded by cows and corn. Bored with the prospects of farm life, I focused my energies on art and music.</p>

        <p>I started off my adult life pursuing a career in youth ministry but found myself spending all my free time doing graphic design. Eventually, I made it my full-time focus and took a job as a web designer, learning how to code HTML and CSS on the job.</p>
          
        <p>Through the years, I've become more focused on development, and am looking forward to understanding the backend as well as I do the front so that I can bring my creative ideas to life.</p>
